The code demonstrates exploratory data analysis using pandas in python
A food aggegator company offers an app that give customers access to multiple restaurants to place online orders.
Once the restaurant has confirmed the order, company assigns a person for food pick up and delivery  
The provided data has important details like restuarants with various type of cuisine, cost of the food ordered, their preparation time, time taken by delivery agent to deliver the food package, information about whether its a week day or weekend the order has been placed, and  the rating customers have given.
I will be performing exploratory data analysis to understand how customer experience can be enhanced, based on the above mentioned features.
